## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **BidGrip** (“BidGrip”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect information when you use our mobile application (“App”).

By using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Overview of Data Use

- The App can initially be used anonymously, without signing in.
- To sync data across devices or prevent data loss, users can create an account using Email, Apple, or Google sign-in.
- The App is designed to help you manage your business, which means you will input data about your own clients and projects.
- The App does **not** display ads and does **not** sell personal data.

- Photos: If you choose to attach them, we store images (such as "before and after" photos) related to your quotes.

We use collected information to:

- Process subscription entitlements.
- Maintain security and prevent misuse.

We do not sell or rent your personal information, nor do we sell the information of the clients you input into the App.

## 5. Subscriptions and Payments

Subscriptions are processed securely by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, utilizing RevenueCat to manage entitlements.

We do not receive or store your payment card details. We only receive subscription status information (e.g., whether you are a "Pro" user) to unlock premium features.

---

## 6. Data Storage and Security

Your data (including user profiles, clients, quotes, and images) is securely stored using Google Firebase infrastructure (Firestore and Firebase Storage). We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. However, no system is completely secure, and use of the App is at your own risk.

---

## 7. Data Retention

We retain information as long as necessary to provide the App and comply with legal obligations.

Account Deletion: You can permanently delete your account and data directly within the App. When you trigger an account deletion:

Your user profile, client list, catalog, and all quotes/invoices are permanently deleted from our database.

Any images you uploaded (such as business logos or quote photos) are permanently deleted from our cloud storage.

Your local device data is cleared.

You may request immediate deletion of your data by using the "Delete Account" feature within the App settings or by contacting nsgn.one@gmail.com.
(Note: For security purposes, you may be required to log in again recently before a deletion can be processed).

---

## 8. Anonymous Accounts and Account Linking

If you start using the App anonymously, your data is stored locally and securely in the cloud under a temporary ID.

Upgrading: You can convert your anonymous account to a permanent one by signing up with an email, Apple, or Google account. Your data will be preserved.

Data Loss Warning: If you log into an already existing account while using an anonymous profile, your temporary anonymous data will not be migrated. If you uninstall the App without signing up, your anonymous data will be permanently lost.
